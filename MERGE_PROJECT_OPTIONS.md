# Options to Merge/Transfer Firebase Project

## Current Situation:
- **Old Account**: kmahari2007@gmail.com
- **Old Project**: civichero-480a3
- **New Account**: kavinchandrasekar4@gmail.com  
- **New Project**: civicissue-aae6d

## Option 1: Add New Account to Existing Project (Recommended)

This keeps all existing data and just adds the new account as a collaborator.

### Steps:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. **Log in with OLD account**: kmahari2007@gmail.com
3. Select project: **civichero-480a3**
4. Go to **⚙️ Settings** (gear icon) → **Users and permissions**
5. Click **Add member**
6. Enter: **kavinchandrasekar4@gmail.com**
7. Select role: **Owner** (or Editor)
8. Click **Add**

After this, the new account will have access to civichero-480a3.

## Option 2: Use New Project and Migrate Data

If you want to use the new project (civicissue-aae6d) instead:

### Steps:
1. Export data from old project (if needed)
2. Update app configuration to use new project
3. Re-upload any necessary data

## Option 3: Transfer Project Ownership

Firebase doesn't support direct project transfer, but you can:
1. Add new account as Owner
2. Remove old account (optional)

## Which Option Do You Want?

**Option 1** is easiest - just adds your new account to the existing project.
**Option 2** starts fresh with the new project.
